# CROM_GAME

I love playing games.

Create one ? Why not.

I think this will be one of big projects that i want to make.

# What kind of game ?

This game will be a RPG

# Which Languages to develop this ?

As a huge JS Fanboy, I'll try to create this game in JS, but in VANILLA !

Using ofc, new features offered by ES6.

# Why VANILLA JS ?

Just for the challenge, and i need to improve my JS skills, if in term i can only use Vanilla and not framework like jQuery, this will be great.

I don't want to use things like Phaser, Pixi etc too.
I'm a web developer after all.

I'm not a huge fan of jQuery, even if i admit it's good.

# This Game is in development... (0.1.0)
